# libgpiod LED Button Example

A very simple example of controlling a LED button with libgpiod (v1.2) on Raspberry PI 4B. 
Tested on a Raspberry Pi 4B running Raspberry OS (buster). but it should work on other relatively new GPIO devices and other linux distributions as well.

## Dependencies 
### Debian
```
sudo apt install libgpiod-dev build-essential
```

## Build
```
make
```
