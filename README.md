# libgpiod LED Button Example

A very simple example for controlling a LED with a button with libgpiod (v1.2) on Raspberry PI 4B. 
Written on a Raspberry Pi 4B running Raspberry OS (buster), but it should work on other relatively new GPIO devices and linux distributions as well.

## Dependencies 
```
sudo apt install libgpiod-dev gcc
```

## Build
```
make
```
